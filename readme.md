# My very fast but efficient but quickly written solutions for Advent of Code 2024

There might be a lot of stuff that can be improved and optimized. Some parts do have some maths behind and I might have (or might not) explained them within the code.

### Some thoughts and learnings

Day 2: Part two was easily solved because I did the part one by substracting and checking distance rather than just checking the incremental. Therefore part two was simply to find the errors. Some pen and paper was involved to check these errors and make the code suitable.

Day 3: Learn regex :)

Day 4: The angle variable to explore these kind of puzzles seems very efficient, i should usen it more.

Day 5: Part two is solved because the puzzle doesn't have constrains on the solution. Would have liked to apply recursion for that matter and force the sorting.

Day 6: Python is very interesting, and apparently ```.copy()``` allows you to modify the copied lists without modifying the raw one. However this is untrue if you apply the method on a list of lists and you modify an element within the lists.
